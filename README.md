Created with CodeSandbox

This project is build with React. The user is presented with three genres (Rock, Pop and Hip-hop) to choose from, and upon clicking on one, three trending songs corresponding to the genre are displayed, along with rating and artist name.

The song names, ratings and artist names are stored as an object where the key is the genre and the property is the details of the songs. When the user clicks on one of the genres, the keys in the object are displayed.
